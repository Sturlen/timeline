## What is it
An Animation Timeline, which syncronize changes in a set of values over time. These values will be tweened between specified keyframes, and you can choose the method of tweening yourself.



## Why make it
For use in my Realtime wallpaper, mostly for lerping sun positon and color based on time of day.
I've made a similar thing before, but it was way to fragile.
